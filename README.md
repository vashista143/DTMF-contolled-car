# DTMF-contolled-car
Project that aims to overcome the problem of NLOS and range problems by approaching mobile technology through which we can control the robot being anywhere in the world
**Project Objective**
The project aims to address Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) and range problems in robot control by leveraging mobile technology. It allows users to control robot movements remotely from anywhere in the world using a cellphone.
**Overview:-**
This cellphone-controlled robot operates through dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signals generated by a cellphone keypad. The signals are decoded by a DTMF decoder, which converts them into digital instructions to control the robot's movement. The project utilizes an Arduino Nano microcontroller, a DTMF module, and an L293D motor driver to achieve seamless communication and control.
**Key Components:-**
Arduino Nano: Microcontroller for processing the decoded DTMF signals.
DTMF Module: Receives and decodes dual-tone signals from the cellphone.
L293D Motor Driver: Interfaces the microcontroller with the motors to control the robot's movement.
BO Gear Motors, BO Wheels, and Castor Wheel: Provide mobility to the robot.
Breadboard and Jumpers: For connecting components.
Battery: Power supply for the system.
**Applications:-**
Military and Law Enforcement Operations
Search and Rescue Missions
Scientific Research
Home Appliance Control
**Future Enhancements:-**
Integration of IR sensors for obstacle detection.
Implementation of password protection for added security.
Incorporation of an alarm phone dialer.
Addition of a camera for video feedback.****
